# Spoke API

Foonster Technology was contacted to integrate the Spoke API with the Tyfoon WMS / Magento / and x-Cart platforms.    This API class was created to support this requested functionality, 

## Disclaimer

Foonster Technology is not associated with Spoke or CaseMate in any way form or fashion.  However, since they were not able to provide a PHP Class to support this we built our own.  We have attached the documentation that we were provided and if it changes, please let us know so the class can be updated.

## Business Requirements

The Spoke Order API allows you to send orders to SPOKE automatically without having to key in information manually into the B2B portal.

You must be provided with credentials to access the API. These credentials can be used to access a staging and production environment. Staging should be used for development and testing. Once everything is approved by SPOKE, your credentials will be moved to production and one final test run will be done on production. - per Spoke.
